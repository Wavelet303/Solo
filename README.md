This is the darknet base segmentation deep neural network and it is also have the ability to perform object detection and segmentation at the same time. In the iNES lab of Gachon University, we worked on this idea and we successfully got efficient results. In the same hand, our new network is computationally better and faster than Segnet,FCN, and Yolo family. Therefore, we would like to share all the essential knowledge regarding to it.
